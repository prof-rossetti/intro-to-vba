# Macros

A **Macro** is a mechanism for "recording" a set of manual tasks or operations performed by a user in MS Excel and subsequently "playing back", or automating the execution of, those tasks.

> TIP: Although macros are powerful automation tools, the code they generate can be much more confusing and verbose, and less well understood, than the code you would otherwise need to write from scratch to perform the same tasks. For this reason, the professor recommends you prefer writing your own code over relying on code generated by macros. However, it can at some times be illustrative to see what kind of code a macro will generate. Use them with caution!

## Recording

  1. Click "Developer" > "Record Macro", then assign it a unique name and optional description.
  2. Manually perform one or more actions via the front-end MS Excel interface.
  3. Click "Developer" > "Stop Recording".

## Executing

Execute a macro manually by selecting it from the "Developer" > "Macros" menu and pressing "Run".

Alternatively, execute a macro programmatically in VBA by using the `Call` keyword followed by the name of the macro. For example:

```vb
Call Macro1
```
